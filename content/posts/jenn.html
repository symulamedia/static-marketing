				Photography is about preserving important moments. It's my passion to be able to help you do just that - preserve precious moments forever. My style of photography is candid documentary-style; photos are awkward, but my job is to help you feel confident and forget the camera!

				Whether it's an engagement, a family session, your fuzzy friend, or a birthday party - I'd love to help.
