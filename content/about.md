### About Jenn

Meet Jenn, a passionate photographer with an unwavering love for capturing the essence and beauty through her lens. With over two decades of experience in the field, Jenn has honed her skills to perfection and has taken on the challenge of pursuing her passion into a business. Additionally, she enjoys photographing engagements, weddings, portraits of humans and animals alike! (Coming soon!)

When Jenn isn't behind the camera, she can be found indulging in her other interests. An avid reader and writer, she immerses herself in the world of literature via her Kindle so that she can be on the go with a good read. She also thrives on the exhilaration of a vigorous cycling session on her Peloton, embracing the opportunity to challenge herself physically and mentally.

Above all, Jenn cherishes quality time with her loved ones. Her family holds a special place in her heart, with her partner, Andrew, and their cherished dog-son, Finn, adding warmth and joy to their lives. Whether it's exploring the northeastern coasts or hiking the White Mountains in New Hampshire, or simply sharing quiet moments at their home in the South End, their bond is a constant source of happiness and support.

Jenn's journey in the world of real estate photography took a transformative turn when she realized the growing demand for comprehensive visual solutions in the industry that are personal too.
