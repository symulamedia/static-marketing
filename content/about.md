Jenn Symula has been capturing intentional and genuine moments for the last 19 years. Jenn has been known to photograph all aspects of life — people, pets, and places alike.

Outside of photography, Jenn is an avid Peloton user and food enthusiast. Jenn lives in Boston with her partner, Andrew, and their dog-son, Finn. 

One of the most important aspects of selling a home is capturing its beauty with the right lighting, angles, and partnership that you trust.
