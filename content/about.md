## About Us

#### Hi, I'm Jenn!

I have been capturing intentional and genuine moments for the last 19 years. I have been known to photograph all aspects of life — people, pets, and places alike. I live and breathe every kind of vertical that photography can align with; weddings, engagements, professional headshots, real estate photos, aerial drone photos, and now matterports. 

Outside of photography, I am an avid Peloton user and food enthusiast. I live in Boston with my partner, Andrew, and our dog-son, Finn. 

One of the most important aspects of selling a home is capturing its’ beauty with the right lighting, angles, and partnership that you trust.
